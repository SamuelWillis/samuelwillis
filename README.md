I'm Samuel Willis, a Software Developer. Here you'll find all the little bits
and pieces that I work on.

Currently I am:

* Am the Lead Developer at [OneFeather](https://www.onefeather.ca/) where we are
  working on decolonializing the Indigenous experience in Canada.
* Snowboarding as much as I can and dipping my toes in backcountry touring.
* Trying to figure out, and stick to, a small tech related side project
